     <h1>Waiver Wire Pickup Guide</h1>
     

     <p>Mastering the waiver wire is a crucial part of having a winning team in fantasy basketball. Below you can learn the main things to consider when deciding who to pickup.  <p>
     </p>
     <h3>1. Last 7 and PR7</h3>
     <p>
      When deciding who to pick up off the waivers, start off looking at the players stats. Stats that you should play particulary close attention to is fantasy points per game then sort by "Last 7". This will give you a great idea on how the player is doing most recently. Then click the "Research" tab on the player list and sort by "PR7" (Player Rating Last 7) to see if anyone else stands out.</span>

        <h3>2. Injuries</h3>


   <p>You need to be up to date if someone gets injured in the league. This usually creates opportunity for other players that could be worth picking up. Ask yourself who is going to be the main beneficiary of the playing time when that player is out. Did that player do well while the injured player was out in the past? Having a quality pickup after an injury can be a season changer for your team.</p>

   <p>You also want to look at all of the injured players to see if a quality player is about to start playing again. Someone could have dropped a stud that has been injured for 2 months but is about to come back. There could be someone in your league that people are forgetting about.</p>
    
     
   <h3>3. Daily Leaders</h3>

     <p>Another good tip to pick up players on the waiver wire is to look at the daily leaderboards while games are in progress. If you see someone that has 17 fantasy points in the first quarter and has been doing well recently, chances are, you should pick that player up. If you look at the daily leaderboards you could see something before others do to give you a leg up on the competition. </p>

      <h3>4. Minutes</h3>

     <p>You should also pay very close attention to the minutes the a player puts in each night. Check to see if their minutes has a positive trend, or incresing over time. This is a great thing to look out for if you are looking to grab a steal off the waiver wires. </p>
