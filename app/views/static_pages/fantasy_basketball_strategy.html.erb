     <h1>Fantasy Strategy Guide</h1>
     <h3>1. Draft Day</h3>

     <p>Knowing the fundamentals of fantasy basketball can make the difference between winning your fantasy league and finishing dead last. When draft day rolls around, there are two important things that you should consider before drafting a player. Even though a player was good last year, it does not mean that they will be this year so you can not go by just last years stats.
     </p>

     <p>
      To have a winning team you must be up to date with the roles of the players you are considering drafting. The player's team could have drafted a rookie that will take over that person's role in the starting lineup and you just wasted a pick on a bench warmer. You also have to consider if the player has moved to a different team in the league and if will he have a bigger or smaller role there.</span>

   <p>Once you have a clear vision on the potential player's role, you should next check out the stats. This includes taking into consideration this year's projections and also last year's stats for every player you are considering. Even though the predictions are not that accurate, a player could be injured for the first 2 months of the season and you could have missed it if you just went based on last year's stats. </p>

 

   <p>When looking at last year's stats, you should usually focus on what the player did in the last quarter of the season. The players roles could have changed later in the season and the stats only show you how many fantasy points per game (FPPG), when what you really need to know is how many fantasy points per minute they have scored to show you the true value of a player.</p> <a href="http://rotomonster.com/"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9jEuJmQ.png" class="img-rounded" style="width:30px; height:30px;"/>

   <h3>2. Early Round Picks</h3>

     <p>When starting off your draft, I would try and avoid shooting guards other than the few elite players (Harden, Westbrook, etc) and I would focus on acquiring a quality point guard and a quality big man. The reason you do not want to waste top picks on most shooting guards is because of efficiency. Every time a player misses a shot it subtracts a point from your score. The other main reason to go after a point guard and big man that can score first is because they put up points in a plethora of different categories. Plenty of people can score in the league, but not many can acquire multiple steals, blocks, and assists a game.</p>

     <h3>3. Late Round Picks</h3>

     <p>In the later stages of the fantasy basketball draft, look to grab some people players that are consistent and some with high upside. Look to grab some veterans that put up pretty consistent numbers so you are knowing what you are getting to make your team well rounded. Also, look to grab some rookies or second year players that have the possibility of having a break out year.</p>

     <h2>Week 1 - Start of Season</h2>

     <img src="http://i.imgur.com/imFWahi.png" class="img-rounded" style="width:450px; height:450px;" />
     <h3>Setting Your Lineup</h3>

     <p>All your players are drafted and you are ready to kick off the season. Now what? The first thing you have to do is set your lineup. A few guidelines when setting your lineup will help you increase your chance of winning greatly. The first thing is to check and see how many games your players have coming up to make sure you have the most games possible that week to count towards your total score. The next thing you check is any of your players are injured. You never want to start an injured player and give the other opponent the win. The last and most important thing you want to look at is the stats on the player's recent fantasy numbers. Are his numbers going up or down? Is he playing the same amount of time as before? How has he been doing the last 7 games? These are all questions you need to ask yourself when evaluating players to pick for your lineup.</p>

  <h2> More Fantasy Basketball Advice</h2>

 <p>ESPN senior fantasy analyst Matthew Berry will tell you that you can win your league with the help of four simple words: "point guards" and "power forwards." Of course, there are plenty of other successful draft strategies, but the point guards/power forwards philosophy has worked for me for years, and I'm not about to abandon it now.</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, the point guards/power forwards strategy is fairly straightforward, but to better define the strategy, it's all about what one of our editors calls "multicategoricalicity," defined as a player's propensity to contribute in multiple unrelated fantasy categories.</p>

 <img src="http://i.imgur.com/envtlJ1.png" class="img-rounded" style="width:300px; height:300px;" />


<p>
James Harden's ability to put up elite point guard-like stats at another position makes him one of the most valuable fantasy assets.
Essentially, the strategy involves loading up on guards who can score, dish, steal and hit 3-pointers (typically point guards) and big men who can score, rebound and block shots (typically power forwards). Fill the spots around them with a few quality swingmen who can score, drain the 3 and create steals, along with a few centers who can bolster your rebounding and shot-blocking numbers, and you'll have yourself a well-rounded squad that can compete in categories across the board.</p>

<p>It's far less about the actual positions and much more about the scarcity of certain categories such as assists, steals, blocks and 3-pointers. Rather than thinking of point guards and power forwards, think of players who act like point guards and power forwards. James Harden technically isn't a point guard, but he acts like one on the court. More importantly, he gets stats like a point guard.</p>

<p>When you're finished assembling your squad, you should have:

• Guards and small forwards who excel in the following categories: points, assists, steals, 3-pointers and free throw percentage.

• Forwards and centers who excel in the following categories: points, rebounds, blocks and field goal percentage.

Now that you have a basic feel for the strategy, let's dig a little deeper into the reasoning behind it and specifically what types of players you should be looking for.
</p>

<p>

Targeting multicategory producers and rare categories


For the strategy to work, it is imperative to place a premium on players who can contribute in the rare categories in fantasy hoops. For the most part, points and rebounds are the most readily available categories. Lots of players score, while plenty grab rebounds. But how many guys get assists? What about steals, blocks and 3-pointers? Not too many. That's why we target these categories, just like we target saves and stolen bases in baseball.

</p>

 <img src="http://i.imgur.com/cDcrqrs.png" class="img-rounded" style="width:300px; height:350px;" />


<p>
There are many reasons why Chris Paul is among the elite options in fantasy basketball.
So, who gets assists? Point guards, right? Sure, there are some players who get assists from a non-point-guard slot (think Harden, LeBron James and Andre Iguodala), but it's typically point guards who are racking up the high assist totals. Consider that among eligible players, only the following 28 averaged five-plus assists last season:
</p>

<p>Rajon Rondo, Chris Paul, Greivis Vasquez, Jrue Holiday, Deron Williams, Tony Parker, Russell Westbrook, Goran Dragic, Jameer Nelson, Ricky Rubio, LeBron James, Jeff Teague, Jose Calderon, Stephen Curry, Ty Lawson, Brandon Jennings, Damian Lillard, Kyle Lowry, Mike Conley, Jeremy Lin, Monta Ellis, Kobe Bryant, Andre Miller, James Harden, Kemba Walker, Jarrett Jack, Andre Iguodala and Darren Collison.<p>

<p>Obviously, it won't be the same list in 2013-14, but chances are we'll see around 22 to 28 players average five or more assists this season. Let's say that you draft four players who average five-plus assists. You'll be dominant in assists for sure, at least a top-three finish in roto leagues. But what about everything else that we want from our guard categories? Well, that's why we can't just draft any guard who gets assists. Preferably, we want to get guards who contribute in more than just one of the rare categories (assists, steals and 3-pointers).</p>

For argument's sake, let's drop all the players from the above list who failed to average at least a 3-pointer and a steal per game last season. That leaves us with:

Chris Paul, Jrue Holiday, Deron Williams, Goran Dragic, Jameer Nelson, Russell Westbrook, LeBron James, Jeff Teague, Stephen Curry, Ty Lawson, Brandon Jennings, Kyle Lowry, Jeremy Lin, Mike Conley, Monta Ellis, Kobe Bryant, James Harden, Kemba Walker, and Andre Iguodala.

 <img src="http://i.imgur.com/yxCam2y.png" class="img-rounded" style="width:375px; height:350px;" />

<p>Players like Greivis Vasquez and Damian Lillard just missed the cut by a few steals, and Kyrie Irving missed out as a non-qualifier, but even if we count them, that's just 22 players, folks. Again, this list likely will be different this season (so don't blindly follow the lists above), but at least it gives you an idea of the type of players we are trying to target with this strategy: those who contribute across the board. Get two or three of these across-the-board type of guards, and you're already looking pretty solid on draft day. I should also note that we are currently in a golden age of sorts for point guards, and this list has steadily grown over the years.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, we're not avoiding all guards who don't contribute across the board. There are some very good guards who don't contribute everywhere. Take Tony Parker, for instance. Last season, he averaged a brilliant 20.3 points and 7.8 assists while shooting 52.2 percent from the floor and 84.5 percent from the line. Unfortunately, he doesn't hit too many 3-pointers (just 0.4 per game last season) and is only mediocre in the steals category (0.8 per game). That being the case, if you draft Parker or players like him, you'd better be sure that you make up the difference in 3-pointers by grabbing a shooting guard or swingman like Klay Thompson or Danny Green at some point in the draft. I mention this because the success of this strategy really depends on how well you cover yourself in each category when you select a player who doesn't fit exactly what we're looking for. (And this is sure to happen, as there are only so many players who contribute everywhere.)</p>

<p>Kevin Love's ability to put up 3-pointers with great percentages makes up for his potential lack of blocks.
A similar discussion can take place for your big man categories. Remember, most guys rebound, but blocks are the rarest category in the game, as only 34 players averaged at least one block per game last season. With that said, we're not all that interested in big guys who don't block shots unless they are able to dominate additional categories like Kevin Love (3-pointers and percentages) or David Lee (percentages). We're also not that interested in big men who aren't efficient from the floor. Since we're already loading up on guards who can hit the 3 but usually have lower field goal percentages, we have to ensure that our field goal percentage stays somewhat stable by surrounding them with big men who shoot at least 48 percent from the floor.</p>

 <img src="http://i.imgur.com/vpv69iU.png" class="img-rounded" style="width:300px; height:300px;" />

<p>Going into the draft, it might help to set up minimum category thresholds. Personally, I like my point guards to get me at least 12 points, 5 assists, a 3-pointer and a steal per game, while keeping their free throw percentage at more than 80 percent. For swingmen, I'm looking for someone who's going to get at least 15 points, 4-5 rebounds, 3-4 assists and either 1.2 steals or 1.2 3-pointers per game. Both would be preferable, but there aren't too many players out there like that. For big men, I'm looking for a minimum of 12 points, 7 rebounds, a block and 48 percent from the floor.</p>

<p>Of course, these are rough guidelines we're talking about here, and I'm not a stickler if a player falls slightly below these marks, particularly if he far exceeds the minimum in a few of the categories that I'm looking to acquire. For example, we're not going to pass on Love just because he doesn't technically fit into those rough guidelines. That would be silly. Love is so dominant in points, rebounds, 3-pointers and the percentages that I'll gladly overlook his deficiencies in steals and blocks.</p>

<p>Bonus points are given to players who can produce those minimums while adding value in categories that we don't expect them to. Take Al Jefferson, for example. He meets and exceeds the requirements of what we're looking for in our big men, but he also hits his free throws at 77 percent. Since most big men cannot hit their free throws (I'm talking to you, Dwight Howard and Blake Griffin!), Jefferson is that much more valuable, and we should mark him up a few spots on the cheat sheets because of it.</p>

 <img src="http://i.imgur.com/64L9gvS.png" class="img-rounded" style="width:300px; height:300px;" />

 <p>

The same can be said for guards who keep a respectable field goal percentage. Ty Lawson is a perfect building block for this type of strategy. Not only does he contribute in all of the traditional guard categories (points, assists, steals, 3-pointers and free throw percentage), but he also connects on 48.6 percent of his shots from the floor for his career. That's pure fantasy gold, particularly for this strategy.</p>

Building on strength

All too often, fantasy owners assemble a team that looks great on paper yet lacks the statistical dominance and diversity to take home a championship. That's what happens when you simply follow the cheat sheets, drafting the best player available without any real purpose in mind. The most common mistake is when an owner fails to build properly on his or her team strengths.

Marc Gasol is one of the most solid big men for fantasy purposes, but you need more behind him to win your league.
Let's say, for example, that you draft Marc Gasol in the first or second round. Think you have rebounds, blocks and field goal percentage locked up? Not so fast. Sure, Gasol gives you a great foundation for those categories, but it's only useful if you build properly on top of that. You want to surround Gasol, therefore, with at least four other players who share his talents. Remember, if you end up having too many rebounds or blocks, or too big of a lead in field goal percentage, you can always trade those away for categories where you are lacking later in the season. Many times, owners who draft a player like Gasol will forget about boards and blocks for a while and won't establish the statistical dominance needed to take the category.

Sticking with Gasol for a second, here's a sample of players you might want to select to complement his talents over the next 8-9 rounds:

Serge Ibaka, Al Jefferson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Anthony Davis, Al Horford, Joakim Noah, Larry Sanders, Paul Millsap, Dwight Howard, Nikola Vucevic, Brook Lopez, DeMarcus Cousins, Roy Hibbert, Tim Duncan, Pau Gasol, Derrick Favors, Andre Drummond, JaVale McGee, Jonas Valanciunas, Enes Kanter and Andrew Bogut.

That's a list of 21 players right there. If you can place at least three of them alongside Gasol, you are setting yourself up quite well in the big man categories. Later in the draft, you'll want to fill in with some shot-blocking or rebounding specialists with upside, and you'll be all set.

While you're building your strength in the big man categories, you can't forget about the guard categories. We have to build on two fronts here. ESPN standard leagues have eight categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals, 3-pointers, blocks, field goal percentage and free throw percentage. Through the first eight or nine rounds of any draft, we want to load up on players who contribute in at least four of those eight categories. That's how we ensure statistical diversity and build a solid foundation.

Ideally, we'd like to have four players who help in points, assists, steals, 3-pointers and free throw percentage (guards and swingmen), and four big men who help in points, rebounds, blocks and field goal percentage after the first eight rounds. It doesn't always work out that way, and it doesn't have to, but that's what I typically look for during the first part of the draft.

After the first eight or nine rounds, you'll want to take a quick moment to review your team's strengths and weaknesses. By that time, you should have a great foundation across the board if you're following the strategy. Of course, it gets harder from here, as you'll be hard-pressed to find many players who will contribute in multiple categories. But later in the draft, you should be looking to load up on specialists and high-upside players who complement your statistical base. 

     <h2> Other Fantasy Basketball Advice</h2>
     <h4>Source: Clipsnation.com</h4> By: Thomas Wood


     <p>
     <h3>1.Be patient</h3> You pick him because you thought he would be good. He has four bad games to start the season, so you drop him. A week later, he's right back where you had him pegged in your preseason preparation, and that obnoxious dude from work emails you daily for the next 6 months to thank you for defenestrating him prematurely. (He writes defenestrating because it's on his word-a-day calendar and that's the kind of guy he is.) I love seeing my buddies tally 200 transactions during the season. It means I got a lot of players I didn't get to draft.
     <p>
<h3>2.Points and rebounds are easy to get</h3>. These are opportunity stats. Someone has to score and rebound, even on the 76ers. During the season, some power forward is going to come into a 25-minute role and give you 14 and 8 with 50% shooting after you grab him hot off the waiver-wire. Worry about the special stuff in the draft and have faith that you can pad these two columns in-season.
</p>
<h3>3.Punt free throw %.</h3> Excuse my mixed metaphor, but in every fantasy sport you can always ignore one stat. For basketball, I choose FT% for a couple of reasons. First, there are many fantastic basketball players who range from mediocre to cover-your-eyes awful at the free throw line. LeBron James has never surpassed 80%. Tim Duncan has done it once. Shaq's percentages look like batting averages. Clips Nation's own Blake Griffin has managed a career mark of 64.4%. If you want to ignore men like this in your draft, you do so to my benefit. Second, FT% is boring. Is that really the stat you want to pay attention to? Because if you care about it, you'll spend all of February and March looking for it.
</p>
In your draft, play it safe early and go for broke late. It's tough to win your league in the first two rounds, but it's stunningly easy to lose it. For years, I had to nail my late-round sleeper picks to atone for my early-round yips. I wanted sexy when I really needed steady. Save your gambles for later. With your first few picks, you are building your foundation. Don't buy your rug before you buy a floor. This rule goes hand-in-hand with...
Pick well-rounded players early and save your specialists for later. Back when he was in Milwaukee and Milwaukee still wore purple, I picked Ray Allen in the first round. I wasn't crazy to do so, because he carried a solid first-round grade. Many of you will recall that Ray Allen was a very good player, but even with his scoring, his primary value came from his 3-point shooting. I spent the rest of the draft trying to fill holes like a cartoon character with too few fingers and a failing dam. In recent years, do you know which players I have selected early? Josh Smith. Andre Iguodala. Blake Griffin. (It always comes back to Blake). I like to get multiple players who can contribute to nearly every column. Kyle Korver will still be there if you want threes. Darren Collison will still be there if you want steals. Mario Chalmers will still be there if you want laughs (or cries). Also, as you mix and match the bottom of your lineup, it's easier to target specific weaknesses when your everyday guys give you a solid starting point in every stat column.
